## Frontend (React.js and Next.js)

### React.js Basics

**Objective:** Create a simple React component that displays a list of to-dos and allows users to add new to-dos, as well as edit and delete existing ones.

**Approach:**
- **Component Design:** Built a `TodoList` component responsible for rendering the list of to-dos. This component maintains state using `useState` to track the list of items and user inputs.
- **State Management:** 
  - **`useState` Hook:** Utilized React’s `useState` to handle the dynamic nature of the to-do list. Separate states were maintained for the list of to-dos and the current form input.
  - **Form Handling:** Implemented controlled components for form inputs, ensuring that state updates correctly reflect user changes.
- **Event Handling:** 
  - **Add Item:** Implemented an `addTodo` function to update the state with new to-dos, ensuring that new items are appended to the list.
  - **Edit Item:** Created an `editTodo` function to handle updating an existing to-do, allowing users to modify items and reflect changes in real-time.
  - **Delete Item:** Designed a `deleteTodo` function to remove items from the list, providing a straightforward method for managing list contents.

**Key Considerations:**
- **User Experience:** Ensured a clean and intuitive interface, with clear buttons and input fields for adding, editing, and deleting to-dos. Provided instant feedback on actions to improve usability.
- **State Management:** Managed state efficiently to avoid unnecessary re-renders and ensure smooth user interactions.
- **Accessibility:** Included basic accessibility features such as proper labeling of form elements and buttons.

### Next.js Routing

**Objective:** Create a Next.js application with multiple pages and implement client-side navigation between them.

**Approach:**
- **Page Structure:** Established a basic Next.js application structure with separate pages for home and dashboard views. Used the `pages` directory to manage routing automatically.
- **Client-Side Navigation:** 
  - **`Link` Component:** Leveraged Next.js’s `Link` component to enable client-side navigation, providing faster transitions between pages without full page reloads.
  - **Dynamic Routing:** Implemented dynamic routes where necessary, such as for viewing individual to-do items or user profiles.
- **Router Integration:**
  - **`useRouter` Hook:** Used Next.js’s `useRouter` hook for handling programmatic navigation, such as redirecting users based on authentication status.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Performance:** Optimized routing to minimize latency and improve navigation speed, taking advantage of Next.js’s efficient client-side routing.
- **User Authentication:** Implemented conditional rendering and routing based on authentication status to ensure appropriate access to different parts of the application.

### API Integration

**Objective:** Integrate a backend API with the Next.js frontend to fetch and manage to-do items.

**Approach:**
- **API Communication:**
  - **Fetch API:** Used the Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the backend for CRUD operations on to-do items.
  - **Data Handling:** Implemented data fetching methods to retrieve and display to-dos, with proper handling of loading states and potential errors.
- **Dynamic Updates:** 
  - **State Synchronization:** Updated the React component state in response to API interactions, ensuring that the UI reflects the latest data from the server.
  - **Error Management:** Included error handling mechanisms to manage API errors and provide user feedback in case of issues.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Data Integrity:** Ensured that data fetched from the API is accurately represented in the UI, and handled any discrepancies or errors gracefully.
- **User Experience:** Provided visual feedback during data fetching operations and ensured that the application remains responsive and user-friendly.

## Backend (Node.js)

### Node.js Server

**Objective:** Set up a Node.js server using Express.js with API endpoints to manage to-do items.

**Approach:**
- **Server Setup:**
  - **Express.js Framework:** Initialized a Node.js project and configured Express.js to handle HTTP requests and responses.
  - **API Endpoints:** Created RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations on to-do items, including routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items.
- **Routing and Response Management:**
  - **Router Configuration:** Organized routes into separate modules to maintain a clean and scalable structure.
  - **Response Handling:** Implemented standardized response formats with appropriate status codes for successful operations and error cases.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Scalability:** Designed the server structure to be modular and scalable, facilitating future expansion and maintenance.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error handling to manage various failure scenarios and provide meaningful feedback.

### Middleware

**Objective:** Implement middleware to log information about incoming requests for debugging and monitoring purposes.

**Approach:**
- **Logging Middleware:** Developed a custom middleware function to log request details such as method, URL, and timestamp.
- **Integration:** Applied the middleware globally in the Express.js server to capture and log request data for all incoming HTTP requests.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Performance Impact:** Ensured that logging operations are efficient and do not significantly impact server performance.
- **Privacy and Security:** Avoided logging sensitive information to maintain user privacy and comply with data protection regulations.

### Database Interaction

**Objective:** Connect the Node.js server to a PostgreSQL database for managing to-do items, including implementing CRUD operations.

**Approach:**
- **Database Connection:**
  - **`pg` Library:** Used the `pg` library to connect the Node.js server to PostgreSQL and execute database queries.
  - **Schema Design:** Created a table for to-do items with fields such as `id`, `title`, `content`, and `created_at`.
- **CRUD Operations:**
  - **Create:** Implemented a function to insert new to-do items into the database.
  - **Read:** Developed functions to retrieve to-do items from the database based on various criteria.
  - **Update:** Created a function to update existing to-do items.
  - **Delete:** Implemented a function to remove to-do items from the database.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Data Integrity:** Ensured that database operations maintain data integrity and handle constraints effectively.
- **Performance:** Optimized queries and database interactions to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

## Database (PostgreSQL)

### Database Schema

**Objective:** Design a relational database schema for storing to-do items.

**Approach:**
- **Schema Design:** Designed a schema with a table for to-do items, including necessary fields such as `id`, `title`, `content`, and `created_at`.
- **Normalization:** Ensured the schema is normalized to reduce data redundancy and improve query performance.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Future Expansion:** Designed the schema with flexibility to allow future additions such as user associations or task categories.
- **Data Integrity:** Implemented constraints and relationships to ensure data consistency and integrity.

### SQL Queries

**Objective:** Write SQL queries to interact with the to-do items table, including retrieving and manipulating data.

**Approach:**
- **Query Development:**
  - **Retrieve Items:** Created queries to fetch all to-do items or specific items based on given criteria.
  - **Count Comments:** Implemented queries to count associated comments if applicable.
- **Testing:** Tested queries to verify accuracy and performance, ensuring they handle edge cases and return expected results.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Efficiency:** Optimized queries to minimize execution time and handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented mechanisms to manage query errors and ensure reliable data retrieval.

## Additional Challenge: Authentication

### Authentication

**Objective:** Implement user authentication using Passport.js to secure API endpoints.

**Approach:**
- **Passport.js Integration:**
  - **Authentication Strategies:** Configured Passport.js with appropriate strategies (e.g., JWT, local) for handling user authentication.
  - **User Management:** Implemented functionality for user registration, login, and session management.
- **Endpoint Protection:**
  - **Secure Routes:** Protected specific API endpoints to ensure that only authenticated users can access them.
  - **Token Management:** Managed authentication tokens securely to protect user data and sessions.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Security:** Ensured robust security practices for handling authentication, including secure token storage and transmission.
